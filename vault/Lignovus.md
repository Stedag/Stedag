Lignovus is the alias I've used since 2015 for my woodworking design.

## Instruments

## Furniture

## Third Edition Pipes

This line of pipes incorporates a unique construction for a classic aesthetic.

The formula is a briar bowl, a steam-bent cherry-wood stem, and a narrow metal tenon. To my knowledge these are the only pipes in the world to use a mortise collar to help keep the mortise strong, the fit snug, and prevent the fit from getting too tight over time.

In leu of patenting this design I've decided I would provide a detailed explanation of it's implementation. I'd also like this site to host the gallery of past pieces that I have sold.

## Thoughts at the outset

I'm not sure yet what fully qualifies as an hour of coding. There are technical/IT skills at the fringes of this designation. I don't know if this challenge count debugging Yaml, drafting AutoHotKey scripts, or writing up documentation as coding. Does configuration of a project count? Does the code have to be written with a Turing-complete set of functions over the course of an hour? probably not. 

To simplify things for myself, **up to half** of my coding practice will involve taking on challenges on sites like Hackerrank or Leetcode. Even if my practice on those sites runs into overtime, I will be sure to add a half hour of my own tasks to the clock. This is similar to the strategy I will employ with my [[100 days of physics]]

## Objectives:

There are a few non-coding tasks associated with "100 days of" challenges and my first coding objectives include automating these daily tasks

- Sharpen my essential CS fundamentals
- Practice with languages:
    1) Python
    2) Typescript/Javascript
    3) Rust
    4) Java
    5) C++
- "break in" vim keybindings for vscode

Possible interest areas
    Haxe

## Highlights:

[[100 days of code.0]]: Forked [The 100-days-of-code repo](https://github.com/Stedag/100-days-of-code) and published portfolio website with Github Actions.
